## Project Description: 
The GOOD BURGER application demonstrates the use of Node.js, Express.js, MySQL and Handlebars in creating a CRUD application. GOOD BURGER lets users create burgers and logs when they are devoured. When a user creates a burger the name is stored in a database. The name of the burger is displayed using a call to the database along with an option to devour the burgers. Devoured burgers are displayed to the user.
